# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive Pomodoro timer application with automatic break management, reward animations, and task/goal tracking capabilities. The Pomodoro technique uses 25-minute focused work sessions followed by short breaks, with longer breaks after every 4 sessions. The application will provide visual feedback, celebratory animations, and task management to enhance productivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a Pomodoro timer that automatically cycles through work and break periods, so that I can maintain focus and take appropriate breaks without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer starts THEN the system SHALL begin a 25-minute work session
2. WHEN a 25-minute work session completes THEN the system SHALL automatically start a 5-minute short break
3. WHEN a short break completes THEN the system SHALL automatically start the next 25-minute work session
4. WHEN 4 work sessions are completed THEN the system SHALL start a 15-minute long break instead of a short break
5. WHEN a long break completes THEN the system SHALL reset the session counter and start a new cycle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want beautiful toast notifications with gift animations when I complete sessions, so that I feel rewarded and motivated to continue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a work session completes THEN the system SHALL display a celebratory toast message with gift animation
2. WHEN a break completes THEN the system SHALL display an encouraging toast message with animation
3. WHEN 4 sessions are completed THEN the system SHALL display a special achievement toast with enhanced animations
4. WHEN any toast appears THEN the system SHALL include smooth fade-in and fade-out animations
5. IF the user completes consecutive sessions THEN the system SHALL show increasingly rewarding animations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage tasks and set daily goals, so that I can track my productivity and stay organized during Pomodoro sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the task page THEN the system SHALL display a list of my current tasks
2. WHEN I create a new task THEN the system SHALL allow me to set a title, description, and estimated Pomodoro count
3. WHEN I complete a Pomodoro session THEN the system SHALL allow me to associate it with a specific task
4. WHEN I set daily goals THEN the system SHALL track my progress toward those goals
5. WHEN I view my goals THEN the system SHALL display completion percentage and remaining time
6. IF I complete a task THEN the system SHALL mark it as done and show completion animation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual and audio feedback during timer transitions, so that I'm always aware of the current state without constantly watching the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any timer period ends THEN the system SHALL play a pleasant notification sound
2. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL display the current time remaining prominently
3. WHEN switching between work and break modes THEN the system SHALL change the visual theme/colors
4. WHEN a session completes THEN the system SHALL show the session type (work/short break/long break) clearly
5. IF the browser tab is not active THEN the system SHALL update the page title with remaining time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to pause, resume, and reset the timer when needed, so that I can handle interruptions and maintain control over my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running AND I click pause THEN the system SHALL pause the countdown
2. WHEN the timer is paused AND I click resume THEN the system SHALL continue from where it left off
3. WHEN I click reset THEN the system SHALL return to the initial state and ask for confirmation
4. WHEN I skip a break THEN the system SHALL allow me to immediately start the next work session
5. IF I'm in a work session THEN the system SHALL allow me to extend the session by 5-minute increments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my productivity statistics and session history, so that I can track my progress and identify patterns in my work habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete sessions THEN the system SHALL record the completion time and type
2. WHEN I view statistics THEN the system SHALL show daily, weekly, and monthly completion counts
3. WHEN I view my history THEN the system SHALL display a calendar view with completed sessions
