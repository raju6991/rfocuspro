# About Rfocus Pro

I want to stay productive while coding. One of the productive way is to use _Pomodoro Technique_. I've tried so many app and website, both paid and free, but they are not customised for my needs.

So while learning frontend development, I am going to create my own version of _Pomodoro Timer_ app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.
